**Models for choice and recall**:      
The name of the model files for choice and recall performance in free-choice test contains three parts.    
**Model set**: constant vs. negative vs. positive    
**Hypothesis for β0/C**: 1beta/1C (easy = difficult, saved = unsaved), 2beta/2C (easy 』 difficult, saved = unsaved), 2beta2/2C2 (easy = difficult, saved 』 unsaved), 4beta/4C (easy 』 difficult, saved 』 unsaved)    
**Hypothesis for Phint_o**: 1Phinto (easy = difficult), 2Phinto (easy 』 difficult)

**Models for confidence**:    
The name of the model files for confidence rating depends on the hypothesis for β0:    
beta0_1 (easy = difficult, saved = unsaved)     
beta0_2 (easy 』 difficult, saved = unsaved)     
beta0_2_2 (easy = difficult, saved 』 unsaved)     
beta0_4 (easy 』 difficult, saved 』 unsaved)
